# SEO STRATEGY — JJ CHICKEN

Written for Almed Retail. This is what will actually move revenue, what will not,
and the order to do it in.

---

## 1. The honest part first

You asked to rank #1 in the UAE for "grilled chicken", "healthy food", "chicken",
"breast platter" and "good food in UAE". Two of those are winnable and worth
winning. Two are neither, and I would rather say so now than bill for them.

**Not winnable, and not worth it:**

| Query | Why not |
|---|---|
| "good food in UAE" | The SERP is TimeOut, Zomato, Tripadvisor and listicles. Google reads it as a *discovery* query and returns aggregators, not brands. Even at #1 the intent is wrong — nobody searching this is about to order charcoal chicken in Mirdif. |
| "healthy food" | Generic, informational, global. Returns nutrition content and delivery aggregators. A restaurant brand does not compete here. |
| "chicken" | Ambiguous head term. Returns recipes, Wikipedia, and poultry suppliers. |

A single-brand site does not outrank Talabat and Deliveroo on generic discovery
terms — those platforms have thousands of times the domain authority and are the
format Google *wants* to serve for that intent. Budget spent there produces
rankings you cannot get and traffic that would not convert if you did.

**Winnable and valuable:**

| Query cluster | Why it works |
|---|---|
| **"near me" / local pack** | 12 branches = 12 catchments. This is where QSR revenue lives. Highest priority by a distance. |
| **Branded defence** — "jj chicken", "jj chicken menu", "jj chicken dubai mall" | Aggregators currently outrank jjchicken.com for JJ's own name. That is lost margin: every order that goes via Talabat instead of direct costs commission. |
| **"charcoal grilled chicken dubai / abu dhabi"** | Specific, mid-volume, and JJ has a genuine claim — first fast-casual charcoal grill in the UAE. Realistically #1. |
| **Dish + intent** — "chicken breast platter", "tawouk platter dubai", "shawarma rolls dubai" | Long-tail, high intent, low competition. Wins fastest. |
| **"hormone free chicken" / "halal grilled chicken"** | The five quality marks are a real differentiator and almost nobody optimises for them. |
| **Arabic** — "دجاج مشوي على الفحم دبي", "فروج مشوي" | The biggest open opportunity. Most UAE F&B sites publish English-only or machine-translated Arabic. Genuine RTL Arabic content is close to uncontested. |

**Reframe the goal:** not "#1 for healthy food", but *"when anyone within 5km of a
JJ branch searches for grilled chicken, chicken platters, shawarma, or JJ by name,
in English or Arabic, JJ is the first result and the order comes direct."*
That is achievable, measurable, and it pays.

## 2. Priorities, in order

### Priority 1 — Google Business Profile (highest ROI, not a website task)
Local pack placement beats organic rankings for QSR. Twelve profiles need:
- Correct, identical NAP matching the website exactly
- Primary category **Chicken restaurant**, secondaries: Charcoal-grilled, Lebanese, Fast food
- Real photos per branch, updated monthly
- Every branch page on the site linked as the profile's website URL (not the homepage — this is the single most common mistake and it wastes eleven of your twelve profiles)
- Menu attribute pointing at `/menu/`
- Ordering link pointing at `order.jjchicken.com`
- Review responses within 48 hours, always

Google Business Profile is where "grilled chicken near me" is won. Not the website.

### Priority 2 — Branch pages ✅ built
One indexable page per branch at `/locations/[branch]/`, each with `Restaurant`
schema, address, geo coordinates, hours, phone, map link and an order action.
Twelve pages targeting "[dish] + [area]" and "near me" intent, each linkable from
its own GBP listing.

### Priority 3 — Branded defence
Own the search for JJ's own name:
- Sitelinks via clean IA and `BreadcrumbList` ✅
- `Organization` + `WebSite` schema ✅
- `subOrganization` linking all twelve branches to the parent ✅
- Consistent `sameAs` across Instagram and Facebook ✅
- Direct-order CTA above every aggregator mention

### Priority 4 — Arabic ✅ foundation built
`hreflang` en-AE / ar-AE / x-default on every page and in the sitemap.
Every string genuinely bilingual with real RTL.
**Blocking:** the Arabic in this build was written by Claude and needs a native
Gulf reviewer before launch. Arabic keyword research has not been done yet and
should be, because it is the cheapest win available.

### Priority 5 — Dish pages (next build)
`/menu/charcoal-grilled-chicken/`, `/menu/tawouk-platter/`,
`/menu/jj-w-batata/`, `/menu/chicken-breast-platter/`, `/menu/shawarma-rolls/`.
One page per hero dish with its own `MenuItem` schema, photography, and
"available at these branches" internal linking. This is what wins
"chicken breast platter" outright.

### Priority 6 — FAQ ✅ schema built, page pending
`FAQPage` schema is live on the homepage covering halal, locations, ordering,
why charcoal, and flavours. A dedicated `/faq/` page should follow — it captures
long-tail "is jj chicken halal", "jj chicken opening hours", "does jj chicken deliver".

---

## 3. What is already built

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | `Organization` + `WebSite` + `FAQPage` schema on the homepage |
| ✅ | `Menu` schema with 16 sections and every item, marked `HalalDiet` |
| ✅ | `Restaurant` schema per branch — address, geo, hours, phone, `OrderAction`, `hasMenu` |
| ✅ | `BreadcrumbList` on every branch page |
| ✅ | `subOrganization` graph tying twelve branches to the parent |
| ✅ | 12 indexable branch pages with unique titles, descriptions and body copy |
| ✅ | `sitemap.xml` with hreflang annotations, 16 URLs |
| ✅ | `robots.txt` |
| ✅ | Canonical + hreflang (en-AE / ar-AE / x-default) on all main pages |
| ✅ | Open Graph, Twitter card, theme colour, geo.region |
| ✅ | Static build, no framework, no render-blocking JS — Core Web Vitals by construction |
| ✅ | Semantic headings, one `h1` per page, real `<section>` structure |
| ✅ | Visible focus states, reduced-motion support, logical properties for RTL |

## 4. Two honest trade-offs to decide

**Prices are off the site.** Right call commercially — one source of truth on
ChatFood, no stale numbers. The SEO cost: `MenuItem` schema cannot carry `offers`,
so JJ will not surface price in rich results, and "jj chicken prices" queries land
on a page that does not answer them. Two options, both acceptable:
1. Accept it. Prices are a small ranking factor for restaurants.
2. When the CMS is bound, sync price into schema only, from the same ChatFood
   source that feeds the ordering page — never hand-typed, so it cannot go stale.

Do **not** hand-enter prices into schema while hiding them on the page. Google
treats schema that contradicts visible content as spam.

**Ordering lives on a subdomain.** `order.jjchicken.com` is treated by Google as a
mostly separate site, so the conversion happens off the main domain. That is fine —
but it means the main site's job is discovery and trust, and the order button must
be relentless. It already is: floating action on every page, in the drawer, on every
branch card, on the hero.

**One thing to avoid:** do not put the 4.4–4.7 delivery-platform ratings into
`AggregateRating` schema. Self-serving review markup that is not collected on your
own site is against Google's guidelines and risks a manual action. Show them as
design, as we do — just never as structured data.

## 5. Measurement

Set up before launch, not after:
- Google Search Console, both `jjchicken.com` and `order.jjchicken.com`
- GA4 via GTM with Consent Mode v2 and a PDPL-compliant banner
- Conversion events: order click, call click, directions click, franchise enquiry
- Track order clicks **per branch page** — that is how you prove local SEO works

**KPIs that matter**, in order: direct orders from organic; local pack impressions
per branch; branded search share vs aggregators; Arabic sessions; calls from the
site. **Not** total keyword count, and not rankings for terms nobody buys from.

## 6. Realistic timeline

| Window | What happens |
|---|---|
| Weeks 1–2 | GBP fully rebuilt across 12 branches. Fastest, biggest single lift. |
| Weeks 2–4 | Site launches with everything above. Indexing begins. |
| Weeks 4–8 | Branded terms consolidate. Branch pages start appearing for "[area] + grilled chicken". |
| Months 2–4 | Dish pages rank for long-tail. Arabic starts landing — usually faster than English, because the competition is thinner. |
| Months 4–6 | "charcoal grilled chicken dubai" and similar reach page one. Local pack stabilises across all catchments. |

Anyone promising #1 for "healthy food in UAE" inside six months is either
misunderstanding the SERP or telling you what you want to hear.

## 7. Beating the competition — what's real

You named six: Nando's, Malak Al Tawouk, KFC, Texas Chicken, Al Laffah and Albaik.
They fall into three groups, and each needs a different play.

### Group A — beatable head-to-head: **Malak Al Tawouk, Al Laffah**
Levantine chicken, same category, similar scale, comparable domain authority.
JJ can genuinely outrank these on non-brand terms.

Target: `tawouk near me` · `charcoal tawouk dubai` · `shawarma platter dubai` ·
`lebanese grilled chicken dubai` · `طاووق دبي` · `فروج مشوي دبي` · `شاورما دبي`

JJ's edge: **charcoal.** Malak Al Tawouk and Al Laffah grill, but charcoal is JJ's
whole identity and it is a distinct search term with real volume. Own
"charcoal grilled" completely and you take a slice of every tawouk search too.
The homepage rail is already renamed *Charcoal Grilled Tawouk* for exactly this.

### Group B — cannot beat on brand, can beat on category: **KFC, Texas Chicken, Albaik**
You will never rank for "KFC" or "Albaik". Google gives brand queries to the brand,
always, and it should — someone typing "KFC" wants KFC. Any agency promising this
is selling you something that does not exist.

What *is* winnable is the doubt that sits next to those brands:

| Query | Why JJ wins it |
|---|---|
| `healthy alternative to fried chicken dubai` | JJ is grilled, not fried. Direct answer. |
| `grilled chicken instead of fried` | Category-defining for JJ. |
| `is grilled chicken healthier than fried` | Informational, JJ has a factual claim — charcoal lowers fat and sodium versus frying. |
| `hormone free chicken uae` | Almost nobody optimises for this. JJ has it on the badge. |
| `broasted vs charcoal grilled` | Albaik/Texas are broasted. This comparison is uncontested. |

Build these as **content pages, not landing pages** — a short honest piece on why
charcoal differs from frying, what grain-fed and hormone-free actually mean, and
what changes nutritionally. That ranks, it earns links, and it is defensible.

**Never** name a competitor on the site to attack them. It is legally risky in the
UAE, it reads as insecure, and Google does not reward it. Win the category term,
not the brand term.

### Group C — the aspirational one: **Nando's**
Nando's owns "peri peri" globally and has enormous brand equity. Do not attack it
frontally. But note what they proved: **flame-grilled chicken can be a premium
fast-casual category, not a QSR discount play.** JJ has the same structural story
and a fifteen-year head start in the UAE on charcoal specifically.

Realistic target: `flame grilled chicken dubai` · `grilled chicken restaurant dubai` ·
`peri peri alternative dubai`. Winnable within 6–9 months with dish pages and
consistent local SEO.

### The play that actually beats all six
**The local pack.** Nando's, KFC and Albaik outrank JJ nationally, but ranking is
decided *per catchment*. In Mirdif, Motor City, Kite Beach, Reem Island and Al Raha,
the question is not "who is bigger" but "who has the better-optimised profile within
2km". That is winnable in weeks, not months, and it is where the order actually
gets placed.

Twelve well-run Google Business Profiles will take share from all six competitors
faster than any amount of on-page work.

### Priority keyword set — build in this order

**Tier 1, weeks 1–8 (fastest return)**
`charcoal grilled chicken dubai` · `charcoal chicken near me` · `jj chicken [each of 12 areas]` ·
`grilled chicken [area]` · `دجاج مشوي على الفحم دبي` · `فروج مشوي أبوظبي`

**Tier 2, months 2–4 (dish pages)**
`chicken breast platter` · `tawouk platter dubai` · `mixed grill platter dubai` ·
`shawarma rolls dubai` · `chicken bowl dubai` · `grilled chicken wings dubai`

**Tier 3, months 3–6 (comparison content)**
`healthy alternative to fried chicken` · `grilled vs fried chicken` ·
`hormone free chicken uae` · `halal grilled chicken dubai` · `high protein meal dubai`

**Tier 4, ongoing (category head terms)**
`grilled chicken restaurant dubai` · `flame grilled chicken uae` · `lebanese chicken dubai`

Deliberately excluded: `chicken`, `healthy food`, `good food in UAE`, and any
competitor brand name. See section 1.
